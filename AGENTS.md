# Instructions for AI Coding Agents

**VSCode-Server-DotNetCore** is a Docker image of [LinuxServer.io Code-Server](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-code-server) with the .NET LTS and STS SDKs pre-installed. It ships a single multi-architecture container image to Docker Hub; there is no application source in this repo (the `.cs` style rules below are carried but inert - see [Template adaptations](#template-adaptations)). This file is the single source of truth for cross-cutting rules. Code style lives in [`CODESTYLE.md`](./CODESTYLE.md) at the repo root - one guide with a General section that applies to every language plus droppable per-language sections.

Treat this file as authoritative for everything else; don't restate its rules elsewhere. A derived repo's **project-specific conventions and public-API/behavioral contracts** also live here, **not** in [`.github/copilot-instructions.md`](./.github/copilot-instructions.md) - that file targets GitHub Copilot / VS Code specifically, while this file is the agent-agnostic one every coding agent is directed to read, so any rule a reviewer must honor has to live here to be provider-independent.

## Git and Commit Rules

- **Default to staging, not committing.** Stage changes with `git add` and leave `git commit` to the developer unless the developer has explicitly authorized the agent to commit for the current ask ("commit this", "open a PR", etc.). Authorization is scope-bound - it covers the commits needed for that specific task, not a blanket commit license for the rest of the session.
- **All commits must be cryptographically signed (SSH or GPG).** Branch protection enforces this on both branches; unsigned commits are rejected on push. Signing depends on environment configuration - `git config commit.gpgsign true`, a configured `user.signingkey`, and a working signing agent (loaded `ssh-agent` for SSH, or `gpg-agent` for GPG). If signing is not configured in the environment, **do not commit** - surface the missing config to the developer and stop at `git add`. Verify before any agent-authored commit (`git config --get commit.gpgsign && ssh-add -L` or the GPG equivalent). **Signing must be live before the *first* commit, not retrofitted.** Turning on `Require signed commits` against a branch that already has unsigned commits forces a rewrite of that entire history to re-sign it - changing every commit SHA and making whoever does the rewrite the committer and signer of every commit (a rebase preserves the `author` field but not the original signatures; you cannot sign another contributor's commits for them). During new-repo setup, never create commits until signing is verified.
- **Never force push.** Do not run `git push --force` or `git push --force-with-lease` under any circumstances. Force pushing rewrites shared history and can cause data loss.
- **Never run destructive git commands** (`git reset --hard`, `git checkout .`, `git restore .`, `git clean -f`) without explicit developer instruction.

## Pull Request Title and Commit Message Conventions

### Format

- Imperative subject summarizing the change, <=72 characters, no trailing period. ("Add 24-hour PM2.5 average sensor", not "Added X" or "Adds X".)
- Optional body, blank-line separated, explaining *why* the change is being made when that's non-obvious. The diff shows *what*.

### Rules

- Don't write `update stuff`, `wip`, or other vague titles. (Dependabot's default `Bump X from Y to Z` titles are fine - keep them.)
- Don't add `Co-Authored-By:` lines unless the developer explicitly asks.
- Don't put release-bump magnitude in the title - no "minor", "patch", "release v0.2.0", etc. Nerdbank.GitVersioning computes the next release version from `version.json` + git history. Dependency versions in dependency-bump titles are fine and expected.
- Use US English spelling and match the existing heading style of the file you're editing: title case with lowercase short bind words (a, an, the, and, but, or, of, in, on, at, to, by, for, from); hyphenated compounds capitalize both parts unless the second is a short preposition (*Built-in*, *EPA-Corrected*, *24-Hour*).

### Examples

```text
Add structured logging extensions to library
Pin softprops/action-gh-release to commit SHA
Drop net8.0 multi-targeting from console project
Bump xunit.v3 from 3.2.2 to 3.3.0
Clarify devcontainer setup steps in README
```

## PR Review Etiquette

> **Mandatory in every derived repo.** This entire "PR Review Etiquette" section is the provider-agnostic review-loop *contract* and must be carried **verbatim** into every repo derived from this template, alongside the [`.github/copilot-instructions.md`](./.github/copilot-instructions.md) "GitHub Copilot Review Runbook" that implements it. Without both in-repo, an agent working in the derived repo has no pointer to the reliable Copilot mechanics and falls back to ad-hoc (and known-broken) behavior.

The repo runs a review loop on every PR: local agent iteration plus remote automated review (GitHub Copilot is the configured reviewer). Treat this as a contract regardless of which local agent authored the changes.

### Merge Gate (read this first)

**Do not merge - and do not enable auto-merge - unless ALL of these hold:**

1. Required status checks are green (`mergeStateStatus: CLEAN`), **and**
2. A Copilot review is confirmed on the **current head SHA** (not an earlier push), **and**
3. **Every** Copilot finding on that head SHA is closed out - all review threads resolved, **and** any issue-level Copilot comments (which have no resolve action) triaged and replied to - so zero outstanding findings remain, **and**
4. The maintainer has given **explicit** permission to merge.

`mergeStateStatus: CLEAN` reflects **only** required statuses - it never reflects open bot review comments, so `CLEAN` alone is **never** sufficient to merge. A green/`CLEAN` PR with an unresolved Copilot finding fails this gate; treat it as "not mergeable" no matter what the merge-state field says. The agent never merges on its own (consistent with "default to staging"; merging is maintainer-authorized).

**Merging is not releasing.** A merge to a release branch does **not** by itself publish; publishing is a separate step in the repo's release pipeline (a scheduled run or a manual dispatch), not an automatic consequence of merging. Never describe a merge as cutting a release, and never trigger a publish without explicit maintainer instruction.

### Expected Review Loop

1. Push changes to the PR branch.
2. Re-request a review for the **current head SHA**. Auto-trigger is unreliable, so request it explicitly via the `requestReviews` GraphQL mutation (now reliable end-to-end - see the runbook); the UI is only a fallback.
3. Wait for review activity on that head. A completed review that raises **no findings** is a valid terminal outcome for that head - proceed; do not re-trigger it or treat the absence of comments as a missing review.
4. Triage findings.
5. Apply fixes or write a rationale for declines.
6. Reply to each thread and resolve what was addressed.
7. Re-run the loop after every fix push until no actionable findings remain.

Drive the loop to green - review confirmed on the latest head SHA and every actionable finding closed - then stop and apply the **Merge Gate** above: all four preconditions must hold, and `mergeStateStatus: CLEAN` alone never satisfies it.

For provider-specific mechanics (how to request review, query review state, post replies, resolve threads), see the **GitHub Copilot Review Runbook** in [.github/copilot-instructions.md](./.github/copilot-instructions.md). This file owns the contract; that file owns the mechanics.

### Triaging Review Comments

For each comment, classify before responding:

- **Bug** - wrong behavior, missing test coverage, or a real divergence between code and docs. Fix it. Reply with the fixing commit SHA when done.
- **Style/convention** - the comment cites a rule from this file or a language-specific style guide. Two cases:
  - The cited rule matches what the existing codebase already does -> fix the offending code.
  - The cited rule contradicts what's in the tree, or industry norm -> **update the rule instead of the code**. The rule is wrong, not the code. Bouncing the same code across rounds is the symptom of a wrong rule. Heuristic: three rounds on the same style category means the rule needs adjusting and the user should authorize the rule change.
- **Architectural opinion** - the comment proposes a different design ("constrain this to disabled-by-default", "move it elsewhere", "add a runtime guardrail"). This is judgment, not a bug. Surface it to the user with a recommendation; don't apply unilaterally.

### Responding and Resolution Expectations

Reply inline with either the fixing commit SHA (for accepted issues) or a concise rationale (for declines). Resolve review threads when addressed or intentionally declined with rationale. Issue-level comments (those at `repos/.../issues/<N>/comments` rather than tied to a specific line) have no resolution action - acknowledge with a reply if needed and move on.

After the final push on a PR, sweep older threads from earlier rounds whose code paths no longer exist; otherwise stale unresolved markers remain in the review UI.

### Escalating to the User

Bring the user in when:

- **Genuine design trade-off** surfaces (fail-open vs fail-closed, narrow vs broad refactor scope, "should we add a guardrail or trust the docstring"). Triage, recommend, ask.
- **Repeated friction** across rounds without convergence - that's the rule-needs-updating signal. Stop, summarize the pattern, and let the user authorize the rule change.
- **Architectural redesign** is requested rather than a bug fix. Surface with a recommendation; never apply unilaterally.

Anti-pattern: don't keep flipping the code on the same style point. Flip the rule once and stick to the rule.

## Template adaptations

Repo-specific deviations from the [ProjectTemplate](https://github.com/ptr727/ProjectTemplate) baseline, with rationale:

- **No application source.** This repo builds a Docker image only; it ships no `.cs` (or any other language) source. The .NET section in [`CODESTYLE.md`](./CODESTYLE.md) and the `[*.cs]` / ReSharper block in [`.editorconfig`](./.editorconfig) are carried whole per the all-files rule but are **inert** here, and there is no `.vscode/` .NET task group. They are kept so a future re-sync stays a clean whole-file overwrite.
- **Docker is the only delivery target.** The release pipeline keeps only the Docker leg. [`build-release-task.yml`](./.github/workflows/build-release-task.yml) drops the NuGet, PyPI, and executable jobs and their `github-release` `needs` entries; [`publish-release.yml`](./.github/workflows/publish-release.yml) drops the `publish-pypi` job; [`test-pull-request.yml`](./.github/workflows/test-pull-request.yml) keeps only the `docker` path filter and drops the .NET `unit-test` job. The `github-release` job relaxes `fail_on_unmatched_files` because a Docker-only repo attaches no `release-asset-*` files (the image is pushed to Docker Hub; the release carries only the source zip, README, and LICENSE).
- **Dockerfile builds from an upstream base image, not from local source.** The image installs the .NET SDKs into the LinuxServer.io code-server base via `dotnet-install.sh`, so [`build-docker-task.yml`](./.github/workflows/build-docker-task.yml) passes only `LABEL_VERSION` as a build arg - the template's source-build args (`BUILD_CONFIGURATION`, `BUILD_VERSION`, etc.) do not apply. The Dockerfile lives at the repo root (`./Dockerfile`), not under `Docker/`.
- **Docker build/lint commands** (no clean-compile task exists for this repo): build with `docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 --tag testing:latest .`; smoke-test a single arch with `docker buildx build --load --platform linux/amd64 --tag testing:latest .`. Markdown is linted per [`CODESTYLE.md`](./CODESTYLE.md) "Markdown and Spelling"; workflow YAML with `actionlint`.
